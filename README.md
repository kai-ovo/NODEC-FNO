# NODEC-FNO
In this project, we propose the NODE-FNO and C-FNO: memory-efficient training of Fourier Neural Operators with the Adjoint Method, and conservation-preserving Fourier Neural Operators. Detailed results and formulations are reported in `nodec-fno.pdf`. For a quick overview of the results, check `poster.pdf` for a poster document. Off-the-shelf data is available by contacting the author; otherwise, data can be generated using the data-generating script.
